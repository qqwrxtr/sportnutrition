                  Fat is essential for the body in small amounts, but it is also high in calories. Consuming too much fat can lead to excess calorie intake which can lead to weight gain over time, so this is a concern if youâ€™re trying to control your weight.                   </p>

                  The type of fat consumed is also important. Studies have shown that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet can reduce blood cholesterol, which can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Fat-rich foods usually contain a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids but choosing foods that contain higher amounts of unsaturated fat and less saturated fat, is preferable as most of us eat too much saturated fat.

                  There is ongoing research on the effects of higher fat/lower carbohydrate diets on athletic performance, and debate about the potential effects for different types of sporting events. For the general population, the advice would be to stick to the population guidelines stated above.
